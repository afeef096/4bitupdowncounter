**Introduction**:
In digital logic & computing, a sequential circuit that is used to 
count pulses is called a counter. A counter is a set of FFs 
including an applied CLK signal and this is the broad application 
of FFs. These are designed as separate ICs (integrated circuits) to 
use extensively in digital circuits and also in larger ICs. Counters 
are available in different types like Johnson counter, 
asynchronous or ripple, synchronous counter, decade, ring, and 
Up/Down counter

**Theory**:
The Up/Down counter is also known as the bidirectional counter 
which is used to count in any direction based on the condition 
of the input control pin. These are used in different applications 
to count up from zero to provide a change within the output 
condition on attaining a fixed value & others count down from a 
fixed value to zero to give an output condition change. There are 
some types of counters like TTL 74LS190 & 75LS191 which can 
function in both up & down count mode based on the condition 
of an input pin of up/down count mode.

**APPLICATION:** 
• This type of counter can be utilized as a self-reversing 
counter. 
• This counter can also be used as a clock divider circuit. 
• This type of counter is used in car parking slots.
